# PHP MVC Router with Autoloading and Service Container

This project implements a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture in **PHP**, featuring:
- Router.
- Autoloading mechanism
- A service container.

The MVC pattern helps in organizing code structure, enhancing maintainability, and promoting code reusability. The router efficiently directs HTTP requests to the appropriate controller, ensuring clean URL routing. Autoloading simplifies class loading by automatically including required files, reducing manual intervention. Additionally, the service container facilitates dependency injection, aiding in managing object dependencies and promoting loose coupling. This project serves as a foundational framework for building PHP web applications with a structured and modular approach.
